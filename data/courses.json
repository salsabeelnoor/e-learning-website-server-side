    "course_details": "This online course is asynchronous, giving you the flexibility to complete weekly activities at your own pace. Essays, written by our authoring scientists, are supplemented by case studies, textbook readings, videos, interactive simulations, image galleries, and more. These resources provide the foundation for assignments as well as online discussions where you will exchange questions and ideas with course faculty and other learners. The course culminates in a final project, which is your opportunity to create activities that you can use with your students.",

    "course_duration": 8,
    "course_details": "This course provides an introduction to the most powerful engineering principles you will ever learn - Thermodynamics: the science of transferring energy from one place or form to another place or form. We will introduce the tools you need to analyze energy systems from solar panels, to engines, to insulated coffee mugs. More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass and energy conservation principles; first law analysis of control mass and control volume systems; properties and behavior of pure substances; and applications to thermodynamic systems operating at steady state conditions.",

    "course_duration": 3,
    "course_details": "This course covers the experimental basis of quantum physics. It introduces wave mechanics, Schrödinger's equation in a single dimension, and Schrödinger's equation in three dimensions. It is the first course in the undergraduate Quantum Physics sequence, followed by 8.05 Quantum Physics II and 8.06 Quantum Physics III. We will cover the whole band width of quantum mechanics starting from the initial experimental observations and ending up with relativistic quantum theory. Quantum mechanics is arguably among the most fascinating fields of science. It has made numerous appearances in modern pop-culture and is present in our everyday lives. Still, it is also very challenging to get a grasp at this topic - even understanding the most fundamental concepts can be very difficult without instructions. However, I think that this most fascinating field of science is often taught either too vague or with a too strong focus on the mathematics. Instead of watching random Youtube videos or going through hundred of hours of university courses, I think that Udemy courses are a nice platform for purposeful learning. You are kindly invited to join this carefully prepared course that will teach you the 101 of quantum physics.",

    "course_duration": 11,
    "course_details": " Nuclear Energy: Science Systems and Society, designed to introduce students to the foundations of nuclear reactions and their effects on processes we use every day for energy, work, or discovery. Students will learn about magnetic fusion energy research and can explore MIT's reactor virtually. Another course option is Understanding Nuclear Energy from Delftx. Students will study concepts of radiation and radioactivity, nuclear energy implementation, and how we might make this fission reaction safer and more efficient in accelerator facilities for human use. The course will explore making nuclear emissions safe world-wide. From neutron stars and photons to the nucleons and neutrinos found in everything we see, nuclear physics offers us the chance to understand how things work on the micro-level. Courses from edX can help students explore the hidden pieces of our universe. ",
